"""Real, per-agent, on-disk SQLite access — a typed query builder over it.

Every agent in the colony owns exactly one SQLite file on disk (see
``Out of Scope``: this is a decentralization-*shaped* simulation, real
local files, no shared global database). :func:`open_database` opens that
file; there is exactly one documented ``:memory:`` escape hatch,
:func:`open_fast_test_database`, named and docstringed as test-only so it
can never be mistaken for a durability claim (per repo Anti-criterion
ISC-66: no test may use ``:memory:`` to support a claim about durable
per-agent state).

:class:`QueryBuilder` never raises for the failure modes a caller should
expect from ordinary use — a missing row, a violated ``UNIQUE``/``NOT
NULL`` constraint — those come back as ``Err(StorageError(...))`` values
via :class:`~template_formal.types.result.Result`. This is a *design*
choice about which failures are "expected" versus "programmer error", not
a claim that mypy proves SQLite operations cannot raise; ``sqlite3.Error``
subclasses are still caught explicitly, at runtime, by the methods below.

Every method below interpolates ``self.table.name`` directly into a raw SQL
string — SQLite's parameter-binding syntax (``?``) covers values, never
identifiers. ``TableSchema.__post_init__`` already rejects a malformed
table name at construction time (``storage/schema.py``), but the methods
below re-validate ``self.table.name`` against
:func:`~template_formal.storage.schema.validate_sql_identifier`
immediately before building the SQL string anyway, as a defense-in-depth
second gate: a frozen dataclass's fields can still be overwritten via
``object.__setattr__`` after construction, and the query builder should
not trust that a ``TableSchema`` reaching it was necessarily built through
its own constructor. The ``column``/``values`` keys accepted by
``select_by``/``insert`` are checked for membership against
``self.table.column_names()`` first, which already guarantees they equal
one of those construction-time-validated column names before either
method ever builds a SQL string from them.

The isolation level a caller may request is restricted to
``Literal["deferred", "immediate", "exclusive"]`` (ISC-15) — mypy --strict
rejects any other string at the call site (see
``tests/mypy_fixtures/bad_isolation_level.py``). A runtime membership
check backs this up because an untyped caller (e.g. a value read from an
external config file at a boundary mypy cannot see through) could still
reach this function with an arbitrary ``str``; the ``Literal`` type gives
edit-time/CI-time safety only, never a runtime guarantee.
