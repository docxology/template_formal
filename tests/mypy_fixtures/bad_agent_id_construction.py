"""Known-bad fixture: Agent construction must reject a bare UUID, not AgentId (ISC-31).

`mypy --strict` MUST reject this file: `Agent.__init__` requires
`agent_id: AgentId`, a `NewType`-wrapped `UUID` -- a bare `uuid.UUID`
(returned by `uuid4()`, never wrapped via `AgentId(...)`) is a distinct,
incompatible type at the type-checker level, even though both are `UUID`
values at runtime. Never imported or executed -- only type-checked in
isolation by tests/test_mypy_oracle.py.
