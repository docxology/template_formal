# Standalone Fork Guide

## Purpose

`template_formal` is the strongly-typed multiagent ant-robot colony exemplar:
illegal-state-unrepresentable ADTs, a session-typed handshake protocol,
affine-discipline resource handles, per-agent local storage/networking, a
decentralized colony coordinator, and an optional formal side-spec (Lean 4 +
TLA+) — with mypy `--strict` used as a real, tested oracle.

## Copy This When

Use it when the research subject *is* the type architecture itself: you need
a template where illegal states are unrepresentable by construction,
protocol phases are enforced by the type checker rather than by runtime
convention, and a decentralized multiagent simulation needs its own local
storage and local networking per agent — not a shared global mutable state.

## Clean Copy Command

From the template repository root:

```bash
uv run python scripts/audit/copy_exemplar.py \
  --source templates/template_formal \
  --dest projects/working/my_formal_project \
  --new-name my_formal_project
```

Fallback when the helper is unavailable:

```bash
rsync -a \
  --exclude '.venv/' --exclude '.pytest_cache/' --exclude '.mypy_cache/' \
  --exclude 'output/' --exclude '*.egg-info/' --exclude 'formal/lean/.lake/' \
  projects/templates/template_formal/ projects/working/my_formal_project/
```

## Required Post-Fork Edits

- Update `manuscript/config.yaml`, `domain_profile.yaml`, `experiment_plan.yaml`,
  and `pyproject.toml` (rename the package, update authors/description).
- Rename the `src/template_formal/` package if the fork uses a different
  package name, and update every `from template_formal...` import across
  `src/`, `tests/`, and `scripts/` to match.
- Replace the type/protocol/storage/network/agent/colony domain modules with
  the fork's own illegal-state-unrepresentable design, keeping the same
  positive-control/negative-control test discipline (mypy-as-oracle fixtures,
  fault-injected protocol tests, colony integration test).
- Regenerate `output/data/colony_demo_summary.json` and the per-agent SQLite
  files before updating any manuscript result claims.

## Validation Commands

From the template repository root after copying into `projects/working/`:

```bash
uv run pytest projects/working/my_formal_project/tests/ \
  --cov=projects/working/my_formal_project/src --cov-fail-under=90
MYPYPATH=projects/working/my_formal_project/src \
  uv run mypy --strict --explicit-package-bases --namespace-packages \
  projects/working/my_formal_project/src
uv run python projects/working/my_formal_project/scripts/02_run_analysis.py
```

For the public exemplar:

```bash
uv run pytest projects/templates/template_formal/tests/ \
  --cov=projects/templates/template_formal/src --cov-fail-under=90
MYPYPATH=projects/templates/template_formal/src \
  uv run mypy --strict --explicit-package-bases --namespace-packages \
  projects/templates/template_formal/src
```

## Intentional Non-Standalone Dependencies

The manuscript renders through the shared `infrastructure/rendering/` and
`infrastructure/validation/` pipeline, and `scripts/00_setup_environment.py`
imports `infrastructure.rendering.preflight`. `src/template_formal/` itself
has zero `infrastructure/` imports — every type/storage/protocol/network/
agent/colony module is pure, project-local Python — so the source package is
standalone even though the manuscript pipeline is not.

The optional formal side-spec (`formal/lean/`, `formal/tla/`) requires
`lake`/`elan` (Lean 4) and a Java runtime (TLA+ TLC) respectively; neither is
part of `--core-only` pipeline runs, the coverage gate, or a forkable
project's minimum requirements. Fork without them if the formal side-spec
does not apply to your domain.

## What Not To Claim

Do not claim a wider mypy-oracle detection class, a wider fault-injection
coverage, or a wider colony-convergence result than the fixtures and tests
actually exercise. `tests/mypy_fixtures/` covers six specific known-bad
patterns (ISC-2/4/15/18/19/31) — it is not evidence about bug classes those
fixtures do not construct. The colony integration test's emergent
convergence result is specific to its three-agent, two-location, five-tick
configuration; widening any of these claims in a fork requires a new
negative-control test or fault-injected scenario first, not a wider sentence
in the manuscript.
